croatian-helper
===============

Some letters and words from Croatian language encoded in UTF8.

Folder txt/ contains croatian letters, transformations to lowercase and ascii,
as well as dictionary.

Everything in txt/ is encoded with utf8.
(txt/wordlist.txt.gz is gzipped afterwards, ofc)

Folder lib/ contains a script which is used to normalize dictionary.
